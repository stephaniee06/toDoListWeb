B. OVERVIEW
A high-performance To-Do List application built with React 18, TypeScript, and Vite. This project provides a minimal and fast setup with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and strict linting rules to ensure code quality. It is designed for users who need a quick and reliable way to manage daily tasks through a web interface.

C. FEATURES
- Fast Refresh: Instant UI updates during development using Vite plugins.
- Task Management: Full CRUD capabilities (Add, View, Toggle, and Delete tasks).
- Type Safety: Built with TypeScript to prevent runtime errors and improve developer experience.
- State Persistence: Tasks are saved locally so they don't disappear on page refresh.
- Production Ready: Includes optimized ESLint configurations for type-aware linting.

D. TECH STACK
- Framework: React (Vite)
- Language: TypeScript
- Transpiler: SWC / Babel (Fast Refresh enabled)
- Linter: ESLint (Type-checked configuration)

E. RULES
- Initialization: Run npm install to set up the development environment.
- Development: Use npm run dev to start the local server with HMR.
- Building: Use npm run build to create a production-ready bundle in the dist folder.
- Usage: Enter a task, manage your list, and the app handles the rest.
